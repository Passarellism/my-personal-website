    <p>Hey! My name is Steve Passarelli. I was born on December 21st, 1992 in Nashua New Hampshire. I grew up in New Hampshire, and attended college at Saint Michael's College in Burlington Vermont. After living in Burlington for 5 years, I moved to Boulder, Colorado. Having lived here for 6 years, I have worked a variety of jobs, from HR, to Financial Accounting, and Sales. I spend my time here skiing, biking and rock climbing. </p>
    <p>One thing most people don't know is I initially moved out here to be a photographer. Want to see my work? Check out my portfolio!</p>
